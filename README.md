# 100 Days of Code

![100 Days of Code](images/100_days_of_code.jpeg)<br>

## Data Structure and Algorithms
- In this repository I will to post links to 3 DSA questions everyday, from Day 1 to Day 100.
- On Saturdays and Sundays I will post 6 questions, out of which 4 will be compulsory and other 2 will be optional.
- You should complete the questions in 90 min and give 30 min to understand the solution if you are unable to solve the question, but there is no fast and hard rules
- These links will be present in this readme as well as in the issue sections.
- You should make a folder in this repository with your name in which you can create your own readme, where you tell if you completed the tasks on that particular day or not. for eg checkout [1.demo](1.demo/) folder.
- You can submit a pull-request after you have completed the given questions.
- The questions will be easy in the beginning and they will gradually become harder and harder day by day.
- There will be an *IDIOT* box for each day in this readme , displaying the names of people who participated in **100 Days of Code** and did not complete the given tasks on a particular day.
- All the questions must be attempted in C/C++ or Java. No other Language is allowed.
> Here you can check my schedule for completing the [**100 Days of Code**](KushagraShekhawat/Schedule.md)

---

## Google Summer of Code
- This repository will also work as a diary for [**GSOC**](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/about/).
- There will be issue for GSOC aspirants, who can complete those tasks daily for increasing their chances of selection in GSOC.
- All other rules are same as that for **DSA**.

> **Note** : You have to mention whether you are participating in **100 Days of code** as a DSA student, GSOC aspirant or as both.
